## Design & implementation

### SetBufferCommand

Sets a buffer percentage on a named equipment item. The buffer is persisted to storage.

![SetBufferCommand Sequence Diagram](images/SetBufferCommand.png)

**Format:** `setbuffer n/<name> b/<percentage>[%]`

**Behaviour:**
- The `%` symbol in the buffer value is optional and stripped during parsing
- If the equipment name is not found, an error message is shown and no change is made
- Buffer percentage defaults to `0.0` when equipment is first added

**Example:**
```
setbuffer n/STM32 b/10%
setbuffer n/STM32 b/10
```
 
---

### SetStatusCommand

Updates the loaned or available count of an equipment item. Can target equipment by name or by 1-based index.

![SetStatusCommand Sequence Diagram](images/SetStatusCommand.png)

**Format:**
- `setstatus n/<name> <count> loaned` — loans out `<count>` units, decreasing available
- `setstatus n/<name> <count> available` — returns `<count>` units, increasing available
- `setstatus <index> <count> loaned/available` — same as above but targets by 1-based list index

**Constraints:**
- Negative counts are rejected silently — no change is made
- Count must not exceed current available (when loaning) or current loaned (when returning)

**Example:**
```
setstatus n/BasyS3 FPGA 5 loaned
setstatus 1 3 available
```

### Low Stock Alert System

#### 1. Overview
The Low Stock Alert system is a proactive inventory management feature designed to prevent laboratory equipment shortages. It allows lab managers to define a "Minimum Threshold" for any equipment item. The system automatically monitors inventory levels during transactions and issues a high-visibility warning (`!!! LOW STOCK ALERT`) if an action causes the stock to fall to or below the defined threshold.

#### 2. Implementation Details
The feature is integrated into the `Equipment` model and is triggered by the `DeleteCommand`, `SetStatusCommand`, and the `SetMinCommand`.

The execution flow follows these steps:
1. **Threshold Definition**: Each `Equipment` object maintains a `minQuantity` integer attribute.
2. **Configuration**: The user can set this threshold using the `setmin` command (e.g., `setmin 1 min/10`). The `SetMinCommand` validates the input and updates the `Equipment` object.
3. **Quantity Reduction**: When a user loans out an item (via `setstatus`) or removes items (via `delete`), the respective `Command` object updates the `Equipment` quantity.
4. **Logic Check**: Immediately after the update, the `Command` invokes `target.isBelowThreshold()`.
5. **UI Trigger**: If the check returns `true`, the `Command` calls `ui.showLowStockAlert(target)`, which displays the current stock levels and the required minimum to the user.

#### 3. Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the `DeleteCommand`, the `Equipment` model, and the `Ui` during a stock breach:

![LowStockAlert Sequence Diagram](./images/LowStockAlert.png)

#### 4. Design Considerations
**Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Logic-Driven Alerts**
* **How it works:** The `Command` class acts as the controller, performing the threshold check after the data is modified and deciding whether to trigger the UI.
* **Why it was chosen:** It follows the **Separation of Concerns** principle. The `Equipment` class remains a pure data model, while the `Ui` handles presentation. This prevents the Model from being "tightly coupled" to the UI, making the system easier to maintain and test.

**Alternative 2: Model-Driven Auto-Alerts**
* **How it works:** The `Equipment#setQuantity()` method would automatically print a warning to the console if the new value is too low.
* **Why it was rejected:** This would force the `Equipment` class to depend on a UI component, which is poor architectural practice. It would also trigger unwanted alerts during "silent" operations, such as loading data from a save file on startup.

### Enhanced Find Feature

#### 1. Overview
The Enhanced Find Feature allows users to search the inventory not only by the equipment's name but also by its associated course module codes. This ensures that users can quickly locate all equipment required for a specific class (e.g., searching `find STM32 CG2111A` to retrieve all related microcontrollers and sensors).

#### 2. Implementation Details
The feature is facilitated by the `FindCommand` class. During a recent refactoring phase, the execution logic was heavily optimized to adhere to the **Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)**, purposefully eliminating deeply nested iterations (the "Arrow Anti-Pattern").

Execution flow:
1. The `Parser` processes the input and returns a `FindCommand` object containing the search tokens.
2. `FindCommand#execute(Context)` is invoked.
3. It calls a high-level helper `getMatchingEquipments(EquipmentList)` to iterate through the inventory.
4. The low-level string matching is delegated to `isMatchFound(...)`, which utilizes early returns.

**Code Snippet: SLAP and Early Returns**
As advised by clean code practices, we avoid deep nesting. The following minimal snippet demonstrates how `isMatchFound` safely halts execution upon the first match, preventing duplicate entries in the result list without relying on a `Set`:

```java
private boolean isMatchFound(Equipment eq, String[] tokens) {
  for (String token : tokens) {
    if (token.isEmpty()) {
      continue;
    }
    // Early return: As soon as we find one match, we return true.
    // This eliminates the need for the clunky "contains(eq) -> break" logic!
    if (matchesNameOrModule(eq, token)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### 3. UML Diagrams
To illustrate this feature without cluttering a single diagram, the logic is divided into an Activity Diagram for the algorithmic flow and a Sequence Diagram using `ref` frames to abstract lower-level details.

**Sequence Diagram: Execution Flow**
*(Note: Minor parameter details are omitted as `...` for brevity. The low-level matching logic is abstracted into a `ref` frame.)*
![FindCommand Sequence Diagram](images/find.png)

#### 4. Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Extracted Helpers & Early Returns**
    * **Pros:** Highly performant ($O(1)$ addition check). The separation of concerns makes unit testing significantly easier.
    * **Cons:** Requires creating multiple private helper methods, slightly increasing class line count.
* **Alternative 2: Nested Iteration with `break` and `List.contains()`**
    * **Pros:** Keeps all logic inside a single method block.
    * **Cons:** Rejected due to the "Arrow Anti-Pattern". Relying on `ArrayList.contains(eq)` introduces an unnecessary $O(N)$ overhead per matched item.

### Module Tracking System

#### 1. Overview
The Module Tracking System allows lab technicians to manage a central registry of academic course modules (e.g., `CG2111A`). It supports standard lifecycle operations (adding, deleting, listing, and updating student pax) and advanced many-to-many relationship mapping using the `tag` and `untag` commands, which link modules to specific equipment requirements based on usage ratios.

#### 2. Implementation Details
The core of the system is the `ModuleList` class, which manages a collection of `Module` entities. The system utilizes the **Context Object Pattern** to manage dependencies across all module-related commands.

**Standard Operations (`addmod`, `delmod`, `listmod`, `updatemod`):**
* **Add/Delete/List:** `AddModCommand` and `DelModCommand` modify the `ModuleList` registry, while `ListModCommand` retrieves the summary.
* **Update Pax:** `UpdateModCommand` is strictly responsible for modifying the semantic metadata of a module, specifically updating the student enrollment size (`pax`). It locates the `Module` via `ModuleList` and calls `Module#setPax(newPax)`.

**Advanced Requirement Mapping (`tag` and `untag`):**
To support complex lab setups, the architecture utilizes a `HashMap<String, Double>` within each `Module` to map required equipment names to their usage ratios per student. This relational mapping is handled by `TagCommand` and `UntagCommand`.
When a requirement is tagged:
1. The user inputs `tag m/CG2111A eq/STM32 ratio/0.5`.
2. `TagCommand` extracts the `ModuleList` and retrieves the target `Module`.
3. The low-level mathematical validation and map insertion are delegated to `Module#addEquipmentRequirement(equipmentName, ratio)`.
4. `Storage#saveModules()` is invoked to persist the updated relational state.
   *(Note: `UntagCommand` follows a similar flow, calling `Module#removeEquipmentRequirement(equipmentName)` to cleanly sever the relationship).*

**Code Snippet: Defensive Programming in Domain Objects**
To demonstrate our adherence to defensive programming and SLAP, the mathematical validation logic for `TagCommand` is completely encapsulated within the `Module` entity rather than the command itself:

```java
public void addEquipmentRequirement(String equipmentName, double ratio) throws EquipmentMasterException {
    if (!Double.isFinite(ratio)) { // Guard clause: Non-finite check
        throw new EquipmentMasterException("Requirement ratio must be a finite number.");
    }
    if (ratio <= 0.0) { // Guard clause: Negative/Zero check
        throw new EquipmentMasterException("Requirement ratio must be strictly greater than 0.0.");
    }
    this.equipmentRequirements.put(equipmentName, ratio);
}
```

#### 3. UML Diagrams
To illustrate the data structure and execution flow of the complete Module Tracking System, we employ both a Class Diagram and a Sequence Diagram.

**Class Diagram: System Architecture**
*(Note: Minor exception classes and standard Java libraries are omitted. The diagram highlights the separation of concerns between standard module commands and the tagging commands used for mapping.)*
![Module System Class Diagram](images/module_class.png)

**Sequence Diagram: Tag Module Execution Flow**
*(Note: UI rendering steps and generic self-calls have been abstracted to focus on the core Model interactions during a tagging operation.)*
![TagCommand Sequence Diagram](images/tag_module.png)

#### 4. Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Ratio-Based Relational Mapping via `tag`**
  * **How it works:** Each `Module` maintains a `HashMap` linking equipment names to a fractional ratio. Relationships are dynamically built using `TagCommand`.
  * **Why it was chosen:** It provides extreme flexibility. Not every piece of equipment has a 1:1 student ratio (e.g., one oscilloscope might be shared by 4 students, ratio = 0.25). This mathematical modeling allows the system to accurately calculate exact lab demands without data redundancy.

* **Alternative 2: Storing Hardcoded Integers**
  * **How it works:** Instead of a ratio, the module stores the absolute integer number of equipment needed (e.g., "Needs 50 STM32s").
  * **Why it was rejected:** This creates a brittle system. If the `UpdateModCommand` changes the pax from 100 to 150, the technician would have to manually recalculate and re-tag every single equipment requirement. The ratio-based approach automatically scales demand when pax is updated.

#### 5. Future Implementations (Beyond v2.1)
* **Automated Demand Forecasting:** Leveraging the ratio `HashMap` established by `TagCommand` and the current `pax` managed by `UpdateModCommand`, future versions will introduce a `forecast` command. This will cross-reference the required total (pax * ratio) against the actual available inventory in the `EquipmentList`, automatically flagging shortages before the semester begins.

### Aging Equipment Report

#### 1. Overview
The Aging Equipment Report feature empowers lab technicians to proactively audit inventory that has exceeded its expected lifespan. It calculates age dynamically based on the semantic university timeline (Academic Semesters) rather than absolute calendar dates.

#### 2. Implementation Details
Driven by the `ReportCommand`, this feature relies heavily on the `AcademicSemester` class to perform semantic time-difference calculations.

During execution:
1. The command retrieves the current `AcademicSemester` from the environment.
2. It iterates through the `EquipmentList`.
3. For items with a `purchaseSemester`, it calculates the elapsed time.
4. Equipments exceeding their designated `lifespan` are compiled into a report.

#### 3. UML Diagrams
**Sequence Diagram: Report Generation**
*(Note: Pseudocode like `calculate age` is used in place of exact mathematical method calls like `calculateAgeInYears()` to keep the diagram abstracted and focused on object interactions.)*
![ReportAging Sequence Diagram](images/reportAging.png)

#### 4. Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Semantic Academic Timekeeping (`AY2024/25 Sem1`)**
    * **Justification:** Aligns with the domain reality of the target users. University procurement and auditing cycles operate on semesters, not strict DD/MM/YYYY formats. This greatly reduces friction during data entry.
* **Alternative 2: Standard `java.time.LocalDate`**
    * **Justification for rejection:** While standard, it forces users to guess exact dates (e.g., forcing a 1st Jan date if only the year is known), creating artificially precise but practically inaccurate data.

#### 5. Future Implementations (Beyond v2.1)
To further enhance the automated lab management experience, the following feature is planned for future iterations:
* **Automated Procurement Generation:** Building upon the Aging Equipment Report and the Module Tracking System (pax sizes), the system will hypothetically cross-reference aging items with next semester's expected student intake to automatically generate a formatted PDF "Purchase Request Form", detailing exactly how many new boards are needed to replace dead stock and meet student quotas.

### Procurement Report (Automated Restocking)

#### 1. Overview
The Procurement Report is a computed report that calculates recommended semesterly purchase quantities. It aggregates demand from enrolled student numbers across different modules, applies a configured safety buffer, and compares the result against current stock to produce a "To Buy" list.

#### 2. Implementation Details
The feature is integrated into the existing `ReportCommand` class to group all analytical logic in one place. The core logic resides in the `executeProcurementReport(Context)` method.

The calculation follows this strict algorithm for each equipment item:
1.  **Demand Aggregation**: The system iterates through the `moduleCodes` list associated with the equipment. It retrieves the latest enrollment numbers (pax) from the `ModuleList` and sums them up to determine the `Base Demand`.
  *   *Orphaned Tag Handling*: If a module code exists in the equipment's tag list but has been deleted from the `ModuleList`, it is gracefully ignored to prevent `NullPointerException`.
2.  **Buffer Application**: The `Base Demand` is multiplied by `(1 + bufferPercentage / 100.0)`.
3.  **Indivisibility Rule**: The result is rounded up to the nearest whole number using `Math.ceil()`. You cannot purchase 0.5 of a board.
4.  **Gap Analysis**: The system subtracts the *Total Quantity* (owned inventory) from the *Total Required*.
  *   Note: It uses *Total Quantity* rather than *Available Quantity* because procurement decisions are based on total asset ownership, regardless of whether items are currently loaned out.
5.  **Output**: If `To Buy > 0`, the item is flagged in the report.

#### 3. Design Considerations
**Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Total Ownership vs. Demand**
*   **How it works:** `To Buy = Required - Total_Quantity`.
*   **Why it was chosen:** This is the correct accounting approach. If 10 items are needed, and we own 10 but 5 are loaned out, we do *not* need to buy more. We just need to wait for returns. Using `Available` would lead to massive over-purchasing during active semesters.

**Alternative 2: Available Stock vs. Demand**
*   **How it works:** `To Buy = Required - Available_Quantity`.
*   **Why it was rejected:** As mentioned above, this leads to double-purchasing. If an item is temporarily loaned, it is still an asset we own. Procurement budgets should only be spent on actual inventory deficits, not temporary shortages.

### `UiTable`: Dynamic UI Table Generation Utility

#### 1. Overview
As Equipment Master is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application, presenting structured data (such as inventory lists or command help tables) in a readable format is a significant challenge. The **Dynamic UI Table Generation** feature provides a reusable component `UiTable` and `UiTableRow` to automatically format and align variable-length data into neat, spreadsheet-like views. This component is heavily utilized by commands like `ListCommand` and `HelpCommand`.

#### 2. Implementation Details
The feature is implemented through two key classes in the `ui` package: `UiTable` and `UiTableRow`.

*   **`UiTableRow`**: Represents a single row of data. It serves as an adapter, accepting raw strings or domain objects (like `Equipment`) and converting them into a list of cell values. It also handles the low-level string padding logic.
*   **`UiTable`**: Acts as the layout engine. It collects multiple `UiTableRow` objects and calculates the maximum width required for each column by scanning all rows. This ensures that columns are perfectly aligned regardless of the data length.

When `ListCommand` is executed:
1.  It instantiates a new `UiTable`.
2.  It streams the `EquipmentList` and maps each `Equipment` object into a `UiTableRow`.
3.  Each row is added to the table.
4.  Finally, `table.toString()` is called. This triggers the calculation of column widths (`getColumnWidth`) and the generation of the final formatted string with indices and separators.

Similarly, `HelpCommand` utilizes `UiTable` but enables the `hasHeader` flag, allowing it to render a title row ("Command" | "Format") without the auto-generated numeric index.

## Product scope
### Target user profile

Our primary target user is **Senior Lab Technicians** (e.g., Mr. Ho Fook Mun at the ECE Department). Their profile is defined by the following characteristics:
* **Environment:** Works in a fast-paced laboratory environment, frequently dealing with long queues of students borrowing equipment during peak periods (e.g., Week 4 of the semester).
* **Technical Preferences:** Highly proficient with a keyboard and prefers typing over using a mouse. Favors a Command Line Interface (CLI) because it allows for rapid, uninterrupted data entry compared to navigating through bulky graphical menus.
* **Core Pain Points:** 
  * Cannot quickly calculate total available stock versus loaned stock using paper logbooks.
  * Struggles to track which specific modules (e.g., EE2026, CG2111A) are consuming the most resources.
  * Relies on guesswork for end-of-semester budget declarations and procurement requests due to a lack of automated aging tracking.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Environment:** The system should work seamlessly on any mainstream Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux) that has **Java 17** or above installed.
2. **Performance:** The system should respond to standard user commands (e.g., adding, finding, or listing items) within 100 milliseconds to support rapid typing during busy lab hours.
3. **Data Storage:** Data should be stored locally in human-editable text files (e.g., `.txt` or `.json`). The system should not rely on an external Database Management System (DBMS) or require an active internet connection, ensuring the lab can operate even during network outages.
4. **Data Integrity:** If the local data file is manually corrupted by a user (e.g., invalid formatting), the system should gracefully detect the error on startup and load an empty inventory rather than crashing outright.
5. **Usability:** A user with above-average typing speed should be able to accomplish standard inventory tasks noticeably faster using the CLI than they would using a traditional mouse-driven GUI.

## Glossary

* **CLI (Command Line Interface):** A text-based user interface used to interact with software and operating systems by typing commands.
* **Equipment:** A physical asset in the laboratory (e.g., STM32 board, Basys3 FPGA, Oscilloscope) managed by the system.
* **Module:** An academic course offered by the university (e.g., `CG2111A`, `EE2026`).
* **Pax:** The total number of students enrolled in a specific module.
* **Academic Semester (AY):** The semantic time format used to track equipment age (e.g., `AY24/25 Sem1`).
* **Safe Dereferencing:** The automated process of unlinking an equipment from a module when that module is deleted, ensuring the equipment record itself is not accidentally destroyed.

## Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to manually test the application.

### 1. Launch and Initialization
1. **Initial launch:** Download the latest `EquipmentMaster.jar` file and copy it into an empty folder.
2. Open a command terminal in that folder and run the command: `java -jar EquipmentMaster.jar`.
  * **Expected:** The application launches successfully, displaying a welcome message and an empty inventory list. A new `data` folder is automatically created in the same directory.

### 2. Loading Sample Data
To test the system with pre-populated data without typing everything manually:
1. Close the application if it is running.
2. Navigate to the newly created `data` folder.
3. Replace the contents of the auto-generated storage files (e.g., `equipment.txt`, `module.txt`) with valid sample data provided by the development team.
4. Relaunch the application.
  * **Expected:** The system loads the sample data successfully, and typing `list` or `listmod` displays the populated items.

### 3. Testing the Enhanced Find Feature
1. **Prerequisite:** Ensure the system has at least one equipment tagged to a module (e.g., "STM32" tagged to "CG2111A").
2. **Test Case:** Type `find CG2111A` and press Enter.
  * **Expected:** The system returns a list of all equipment associated with that module, even if the equipment name itself does not contain the string "CG21".
3. **Test Case:** Type `find nonExistentItem`.
  * **Expected:** The system displays a message indicating that 0 items were found.

### 4. Testing the Aging Equipment Report
1. **Prerequisite:** Ensure the inventory contains equipment with different `purchaseSemester` values (some older than their `lifespan`, some newer).
2. **Setup Context:** Type `setsem AY25/26 Sem1` (or any future semester to simulate time passing) to set the system's current academic context.
  * **Expected:** The system confirms the current semester has been updated.
3. **Test Case:** Type `report aging` and press Enter.
  * **Expected:** The system uses the currently set academic semester (from `Context#getCurrentSemester()`) to calculate ages, and prints a formatted list of *only* the equipment that has exceeded or reached its expected lifespan.
